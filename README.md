The files include the data used in training, validating and testing the model.  
The data set is also included.  
These are all included as pickle files.  
  
The data files in the data folder have been reduced to a 0.7 fraction sample in order to comply with Git LFS limitations.  
The training, validation and test sets were created from the full data set, so they may contain some data points not found in the included, sampled, data.
